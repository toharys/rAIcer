## üìö Project Description
rAIcer is a project that explores the challenges of autonomous navigation using two robot cars controlled via reinforcement learning (RL). These simplified vehicles are designed to operate in a controlled physical environment and a also have a simulation setup.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the rAIcer project running on your local development machine and Jetson Nano for both simulation and real-world testing.

### üß± Prerequisites
- [Jetson Nano Nvidia](https://www.waveshare.com/jetson-nano-developer-kit.htm)
- [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/)
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- [DC motor](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/263771/specification-of-dc-motor)
- [Servo motor](https://circuitdigest.com/article/servo-motor-working-and-basics)
- [Camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/)
- Serial connection (USB) between Jetson Nano and Arduino

### üèóÔ∏è Installing
1. The simmulation - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OWp7wlhXpLPeueP0ZxFYp-6bc4MzQKhR
2. Clone the repository
   
       git clone https://github.com/toharys/rAIcer.git
       cd rAIcer

3. activate virtual environment in the jetson
 
      cd  home/raicer/move_robot/rAIcer
      source ~/.py3venv/bin/activate

4. running scripts

      on the jetson: python communicate_with_controller.py
      on the arduino, downlode: full_controller.ino


## üß™ Testing
To verify the functionality of the project and the learning algorithm, use the following testing approach:

### Sample Tests
Agent Performance ‚Äì test that the agent improves over time in simulation.

Motor Command Accuracy ‚Äì verify that the correct commands are sent from Jetson to Arduino.

## üöÄ Deployment
To deploy on the physical robot:

1.Set up the Jetson Nano with camera and power.

2.Flash the Arduino with the latest motor control script.

3.From the Jetson Nano, run the robot execution script:

      python communicate_with_controller.py

4. Make sure the robot has a clear field of view and is properly aligned with the road.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Built With
  - [the RL algoritem is based on an artical about DQN ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602)
